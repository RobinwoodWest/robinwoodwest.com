<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Robinwood West Trustees</strong></p>
The Trust Agreement for Robinwood West was set in place in June, 1961 and imposed certain easements, conditions, restrictions, and limitations for the Robinwood West properties. The Trust states that there be three trustees, elected every three years, with special elections allowed, as necessary, to fill the unexpired terms of Trustees who cannot fulfill their terms. Lot owners are entitled to one vote per lot owned and that vote may be cast in person or by proxy.

The duties of the Trustees are:
a.) To prevent any infringement and to compel the performance of any restriction set out in the Trust or established by law.
b.) To maintain gateways and entrance features on common property, as well as the open areas near the pool and community center.
c.) To make uniform assessments of a sum not to exceed $6.00 per year per lot to raise funds to operate, maintain, repair, or alter the common property.
d.) To act as an Architectural Control Committee.
