The board held a special meeting to open bids on March 31.  We received two bids; one was from DNI Properties, and a second was from Community Property Management.  A third company, West End Management, sent a bid that arrived too late, so we were not able to include it under consideration.
 
Both bids satisfied our requirements; however, DNI’s bid was significantly less expensive.  Given that, the board invited a representative from DNI to come to another special board meeting that was held on April 14.  Neal Josehart presented a comprehensive set of services they offer that would benefit our community, including:
<ul>
	<li>Management and coordination of contract services – pool, landscaping, snow removal and other contractors</li>
	<li>Soliciting of bids and the preparation of bid packets for board members</li>
	<li>Election services – from nominations to the final results and everything in between</li>
	<li>Insurance Assistance – procurement of renewal quotes and filing of claims</li>
	<li>Record retention</li>
	<li>Election & annual meeting management.</li>
</ul>
DNI’s team approach includes a Community Manager, a Community Service Coordinator and an accounting rep, as well as senior management support. Some additional services that made DNI’s offering attractive included:
<ul>
	<li>24-hour emergency service line that provides direct access to the Community Manager</li>
	<li>Quarterly classes to educate current & new board members</li>
	<li>Proprietary software to track work orders, and verify general liability and workers comp insurance</li>
	<li>Annual client satisfaction surveys of board members for performance feedback</li>
</ul>
DNI is located in Creve Coeur just eight minutes from Robinwood West, and they manage over 100 associations, including New Town in St. Charles.  We welcome you to explore the company in more detail at <a href="http://dniproperties.com">DNIProperties.com</a>, and review their attached proposal and presentation summary.
