<strong>Judge Rules in Sunshine Lawsuit</strong>

Last month we reported that Judge Kerr was expected to rule on the Strake vs. RWCID case.  This was initially reported in the August and September 2013 issues of the Round Robin.  In this lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of John Strake, the plaintiff is seeking information related to a case involving his friend Stephanie Michael, including the confidential settlement, meeting minutes and votes, copies of legal bills, and correspondence between our attorney and insurance company.

The Order and Judgment are posted below.  The order is fairly consistent with what our attorney told us to expect; the RWCID was ordered to produce certain documentation, but other requests have been denied and Plaintiff was not awarded fees and costs. The Court ruled as follows for each claim:

<ol style="list-style:decimal;list-style-position:inside;">
	<li>The confidential settlement agreement must be provided to Mr. Strake, because the judge in the Michael lawsuit did not specifically order the settlement to be a closed document exempt from Sunshine requests.  Our attorney has a copy of the settlement and will provide it to Mr. Strake.</li>

	<li>All minutes and votes that have yet to be made public need to be made public as soon as possible, which includes approving all minutes and votes that have yet to be approved.  The Board approved a number of closed meeting minutes in the last several months, and <a href="http://www.robinwoodwest.com/community-improvement-district/minutes-and-agendas/" title="Minutes and Agendas" target="_blank">these are now posted on  the website</a>.</li>

	<li>The judge acknowledges that the District does not have any legal bills to disclose, but ordered us to determine and disclose the sums of money expended on behalf of the RWCID for the Michael personal injury suit.  We have asked our attorney to contact the insurance-appointed attorney in the Michael case to get these figures.</li>

	<li>The Court agreed that all correspondence requested was privileged and Plaintiff’s request for this documentation was denied.</li>

	<li>Any claim for attorney’s fees and costs was denied as it was found that RWCID relied on advice of counsel to avoid a lawsuit for breach of contract.</li>
</ol>

We believe this is a fair and accurate result, and the order of the court will protect us from any claims of violation of the confidentiality clause in the settlement.  We have also included a copy of the initial Sunshine Request, along with the guidance we received from our attorney below.  This is yet one more legal challenge that we have had to navigate, and we are glad to put it to rest.
