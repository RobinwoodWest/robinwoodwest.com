<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ROBINWOOD COMMUNITY WORK DAY</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Saturday April 18th 9 a.m – 1 p.m.</p>
We are planning a MAJOR WORK DAY next month. There is a lot that needs to be done, and working alongside friends makes the work seem so much less like work. So, grab your neighbor and come on down to the community center. Even if you only have an hour or two, we can find something for you to do that will make it worth your while. Refreshments will be provided!

We are working hard to make sure we are organized and equipped to get things done as efficiently as possible. We’ll divide up into teams and try to conquer as much as we can. Remember that the more we can do through volunteers, the further our tax dollars will go toward improving the property, rather than paying professionals to do this kind of basic maintenance. 

If you have questions or any equipment you would like to offer for use, you can call any board member or attend the next Board meeting!

The "To Do" list will be forthcoming after the April 6th regular Board Meeting.
