Our Robinwood West Garden Club is a great social network of green thumbs and a great way to learn a lot about gardening for those who aspire to green-thumb status!  The Garden Club is responsible for the maintenance of the beautiful plants and shrubs at our Community Center and Pool, as well as the entry islands to the subdivision.  If you are interested in helping out, please contact Eileen Anderson.  This group would love to hear from you!!!
