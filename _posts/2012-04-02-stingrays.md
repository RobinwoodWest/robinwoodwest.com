The Robinwood West Swim Team is designed for the enjoyment and enrichment of the sport of swimming.  Children have a chance to learn team spirit, cooperation, and individual discipline while developing the four competitive strokes – freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly.

Our team has four basic goals:
<ol>
	<li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Learn skills</span>:  Our goal for each swimmer is to learn and continually improve.  A swimmer’s progress is easily measured by comparing event times after each meet.  Regardless of the swimmer’s place in a race, he/she may be improving steadily, and this is our primary goal.  Improvement for a swimmer is not easily achieved.  Hard work, constant practice, and attention to instructions are required.</li>
	<li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Competition</span>:  We believe competition can be a positive learning experience.  We encourage individual effort as well as team performance and good sportsmanship.  Our team is composed primarily of swimmers who practice only in the summer, not year-round.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exercise:</span>  Swimming is one of the best forms of general exercise.  Any swimmer who conscientiously participates in practice is guaranteed to get “in shape”.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fun:</span>  We believing swimming can be FUN!  The team environment provides recreation and run for the participants as they build friendships and team spirit</li>
</ol>
If you have any questions, please contact a Swim Team Board member or one of the coaches.

HAVE FUN AND ENJOY THE SEASON!
