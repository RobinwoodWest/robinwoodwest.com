We need to conduct our bi-annual financial audit for 2010-2011, and are looking for volunteers within the community to assist with this process. In the past, we have had assistance from resident CPAs to oversee the project. We are simply looking to verify that the established processes are being followed, and identify any shortcomings or recommendations for improvements.

If you have some time and expertise you would be willing to share, we would greatly appreciate it!
