  - Capital Improvements loan is paid off!
---
The RWCID Board is pleased to announce that we have paid off the balance on the loan as promised.  In 2008, voters approved a special assessment that would help to pay down our loan faster, savings thousands of dollars in interest for taxpayers.  When that election was declared null and void in a lawsuit, voters again resoundingly passed another proposition in 2011 to reauthorize the special assessment for the remaining two years. 

While property values in Robinwood have taken a hit since 2008, leaving us with less tax revenue that originally projected, the board has managed to save enough funds to pay down the debt in 2013, as promised.  This has been the result of prudent spending and good financial management.  Due to the ending of the special assessment, you can expect your 2013 tax assessment to drop by 25-30%.   

We'd like to thank all of the many residents who have supported this initiative all along.  The improvements made to our pool, community center, playground, parking lot and entrance monuments have benefited us all either directly or indirectly.  Robinwood West remains an attractive place to live because of our location, quality homes and community assets.  It'll be nice for all of us to have a little extra money at the end of the year to save or spend as we choose!

Thanks,

Steve O'Rourke
President, RWCID Board
