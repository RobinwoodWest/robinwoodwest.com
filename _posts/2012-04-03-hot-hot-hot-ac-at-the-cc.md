For some of our residents who’ve attended events at the Robinwood West Community Center in the past, you know that the sweet spot is in front of a fan in the later summer days as the temperatures increase.  The Goodwill Club is raising money to cool you off and install air conditioning for our social events and rentals of the facility.  The Goodwill Club is only a few thousand from reaching this financial goal and cooling you all down a bit for your future events and meetings in the Community Center.  Keep your eyes and ears posted for the Garage Sale in April and a Trivia Night this fall to help put air conditioning in the center.  At any time, the Goodwill Club is happy to hear from residents and even happier to take donations towards the fundraising efforts in the community.  Contact Charlie Galvin at 434-8009 for more information.
