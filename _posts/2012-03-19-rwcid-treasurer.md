Kim and Curt have 3 grown children, and she hopes one day to have grandchildren she can take to the pool. In Kimâ€™s professional life, she is an office manager for a software development company. Kim brings this experience to the role of treasurer, where she has served on the RWCID Board of Directors since her election in June, 2011.
