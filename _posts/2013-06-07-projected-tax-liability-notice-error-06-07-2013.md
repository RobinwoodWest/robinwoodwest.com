You should have received a notice from St. Louis County showing your estimated tax liability for 2013. You may have been alarmed, as I was, to see the .28 for the special assessment still showing on the 2013 notices. I assure you, this was an error by the county. I contacted Jeff Parks to see if they would send us corrected copies. His reply is posted below.

"Kim â€“ Regretfully, upon closer review, it is confirmed that the .28 portion of the Robinwood West (RW) rate carried forward from 2012 and was inadvertently not removed for the 2013 Property Tax Liability estimates. Also regretfully, generating amended notices for RW residents cannot be given consideration due to the complexity of doing so, the time and manpower that it would involve, and other general operational priorities that must be attended to.
We sincerely regret this error and the resulting inaccurate information provided to RW residents, and most assuredly the inconvenience telephone inquiries present. Would recommending that all such inquiries be directed to me be of any help? "
