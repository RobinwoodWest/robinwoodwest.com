The District has chosen to offer snacks and beverages through vending machines instead of opening the snack bar. The vending machines will offer a variety of name-brand sodas and candy. The machines will take nickels, dimes, quarters, $1 bills and $5 bills. Coolers and food from home still are allowed this year. Refer to the  <a title="2012 RWCID Pool Member Rules" href="http://www.robinwoodwest.com/pool-rrr-2012/">RWCID Pool Rules</a> for complete guidelines.

The Pool Membership Desk (PMD) will open on Saturday at Noon, same as pool opening, and be staffed most hours the pool is open for the first couple weeks. We encourage you to turn in your registration form as soon as possible to avoid delays in receiving your Pool Member ID cards. If received by June 10, residents will receive two free guest passes, a $4 value!

The Pro Pool lifeguards will be checking everyone’s Pool Member ID cards. Each time you visit, please stop at the “snack bar.” This year, all pool members and their guests must sign in with the lifeguard.

Guest Fees remain at $2 per guest. Punch Cards are offered to pool members at $25 for 20 visits (a $15 savings!!). These cards may be purchased from the lifeguards; small change will be available.
