Hello everyone!

In anticipation of the 2014 pool season, please note the following:

When you submit your pool registration form, please be prepared to show identification (drivers license, utility bill, etc.) so that the pool committee may accurately verify
residency. Additionally, we will be implementing a new pool roster system this year that will hopefully better track the usage of the pool by members and guests. Once your
registration form has been received and verified, your household names will be added to the roster and you will be assigned a household number. The lifeguards will have this
roster at the pool entrance for member and guest check-in and collection of guest fees.

Please submit your registration form in a timely manner for prompt inclusion on the pool roster. See you at the pool.
