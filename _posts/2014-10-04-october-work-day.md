<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ROBINWOOD COMMUNITY WORK DAY</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Saturday October 25th 9 a.m – 3 p.m.</p>
We are planning a MAJOR WORK DAY this month. There is a lot that needs to be done, and working alongside friends

makes the work seem so much less like work. So, grab your neighbor and come on down to the community center. Even

if you only have an hour or two, we can find something for you to do that will make it worth your while. Refreshments will

We are working hard to make sure we are organized and equipped to get things done as efficiently as possible. We’ll divide

up into teams and try to conquer as much as we can. Remember that the more we can do through volunteers, the further

our tax dollars will go toward improving the property, rather than paying professionals to do this kind of basic maintenance.

If you have questions or any equipment you would like to offer for use, you can call any board member. The alternate

rainout day for outdoor work will be Sunday, October 26th. Here is the current list of items we’d like to accomplish:

CLEANING – INDOORS &amp; OUTSIDE
<ol>
	<li>Scrape and wash all windows, inside and out.</li>
	<li>Clean the stove oven.</li>
	<li>Dust and clean the main area (i.e. stuff that’s not cleaned normally, dust fans, clean under couch, etc.)</li>
	<li>Clean Sofas</li>
	<li>Wash trash cans.</li>
	<li>Wash exterior walls.</li>
	<li>Clean out/organize kitchen cabinets to store items on counters</li>
	<li>Clean up and storage of outside items:
<ol>
	<li>Old empty flower pots</li>
	<li>Bags of charcoal</li>
	<li>Hose that is stretched across side door</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Setting old cabinet TV out for pickup</li>
</ol>
LANDSCAPING - GROUNDS
<ol>
	<li>Walk around grounds to pick up any trash found.</li>
