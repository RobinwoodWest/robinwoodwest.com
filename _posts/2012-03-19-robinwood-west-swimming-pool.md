  - About our swimming pool
---
The Robinwood West swimming pool is free to all residents as part of the property tax paid to the RWCID. This tax, in turns, supports the operation and maintenance of the pool

Our pool features a swim lap lane, diving board, slide, as well as a toddler pool with fountains and toddler playground nearby.

In addition to being a great place to cool down in the summer months, the neighborhood also sponsors <a href="http://www.robinwoodwest.com/our-community/calendar/">free resident events</a> periodically at the pool like the neighborhood barbecue on Memorial Day or Movie Nights at the Pool.

While you are lounging at the pool, feel free to take advantage of the pool snack bar. &nbsp;The snack bar provides a variety of food and drink that can be purchased by pool patrons.

Nonresidents and guests are welcome to use the pool. &nbsp;Applicable nonresident and guest fees do apply.

The pool is also available for private rental. &nbsp;For rental terms and fees, contact our <a href="http://www.robinwoodwest.com/community-improvement-district/committees/pool-management/">Pool Management Committee</a> Chair, Stacia Bals.
