Robinwood West is a beautiful subdivision of single-family homes located in west St. Louis County. Completed in 1962, our community consists of 478 homes straddling Ross Avenue just southwest of Page Avenue and I-270. We are within minutes from Westport Plaza, Parkway School District schools, and the Edward Jones YMCA.

The streets of Robinwood West are lined with beautiful trees where neighbors are often out tending their gardens, playing with children or taking a stroll. Robinwood West boasts a newly-refurbished swimming pool which is home to the <a href="http://www.robinwoodwest.com/swim-team/">Stingrays swim team</a>. Our <a href="http://www.robinwoodwest.com/our-community/community-center/">community center</a> has also been updated and offers a full kitchen, pool deck and adjacent barbeque and playground areas for neighborhood parties or impromptu get-togethers. Several <a href="http://www.robinwoodwest.com/our-community/robinwood-clubs/">social and community service groups</a> are active in Robinwood West. Whether you're single, have children or are nearing retirement, you'll find a welcoming community in Robinwood West!
