The <a href="http://www.robinwoodwest.com/community-improvement-district/rwcid-bylaws/" title="RWCID Bylaws">RWCID Bylaws</a> require a biennial audit by three qualified individuals (Article VII Section N).

If you are a qualified bookkeeper, please volunteer your skills to help conduct this audit.

Each qualified volunteer resident who can assist will save us the expense of hiring an outside accountant.

Contact the <a href="http://www.robinwoodwest.com/community-improvement-district/committees/finance/" title="Finance Committee">Finance Committee</a> or use our <a href="http://www.robinwoodwest.com/contact-us/" title="Contact Form">Contact Form</a> if you are interested in helping.
