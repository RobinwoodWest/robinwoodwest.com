The Robinwood West Community Center is available for neighborhood meetings and club activities - and is also a great venue for private parties as well. &nbsp;The community center features and oversized kitchen with a hotel-style ice machine and standard french-door refrigerator. &nbsp;The interior features a vaulted ceiling with a floor-to-ceiling fireplace, with plenty of natural light from the wall of windows that look out over the patio leading to the community pool. &nbsp;You name it - you can host it here with plenty of room for up to 99 people.

Outside the building is a park with playground equipment, a field for soccer or softball, and a picnic area. &nbsp;Our Garden Club takes pride in the beautiful flowering shrubs and plants that adorn the entry to this building.

Keep this area in mind and reserve your rental by calling the Community Center office at (314)434-8622.
