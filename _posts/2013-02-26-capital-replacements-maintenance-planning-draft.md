The Finance Committee is seeking input to create a Capital Replacement and Maintenance Plan. This is the spreadsheet we are using to gather the necessary information to create the plan. If you have any ideas you could contribute, please feel free to download &amp; edit the spreadsheet. You can then either return it via email to: treasurer.rwcid@att.net or drop off a printed copy in the RWCID office drop box, outside the East side door of the Community Center.

Any feedback you may have would be greatly appreciated.
