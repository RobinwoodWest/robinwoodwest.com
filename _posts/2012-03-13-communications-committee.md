The Communications Committee is made up of 6-10 volunteer residents that meet periodically (minimum of once each quarter) to maintain communications for Robinwood residents. The committee is responsible for communication tools for use in our neighborhood including:
<ul>
	<li>Publishing the official community newsletter each month (Round Robin)</li>
	<li>Publishing the neighborhood directory bi-annually (RWCID Directory)</li>
	<li>Maintenance of a neighborhood network using Block Captains</li>
</ul>
Additionally, this committee establishes relationships with local businesses and offers advertising opportunities in the neighborhood directory and newsletters.

We are always looking for new and fun ways to connect the residents! If you have suggestions, or would like to join us for a meeting, please let us know.

For additional information, feel free to contact your Communications Committee Chair, Michael Allman at <strong>rwcid.communications@rwcid.org</strong>
