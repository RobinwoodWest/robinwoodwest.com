This is shaping up to be the BIGGEST Garage Sale event held in Robinwood West.  The Goodwill Club continues to accept donated items for the sale from residents.  In addition, two estate sale companies have contacted us about donating the home contents for two resident homes.  This means that the Community Center will be bursting at the seams with loads of good bargains including furniture and other household items.  Please do stop by the morning of April 21<sup>st</sup> to see what this HUGE sale will have to offer for you and your family!

Doors Open at 7:00am  - 2:00pm, Saturday, April 21<sup>st</sup>, 2012
