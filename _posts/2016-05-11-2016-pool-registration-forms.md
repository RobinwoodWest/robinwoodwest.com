2016 Resident Pool Registration 
     The Robinwood West Pool opens Saturday May 28, 2016.  Membership is open to residents of Robinwood West Subdivision by completing a resident form
and providing proof of residency. All forms must be completely filled out, signed by the household agent, and not have any wording crossed out or added.  

The 2016 Resident Registration Form is printed in this issue of The Round Robin, will be posted on the RWCID website at www.robinwoodwest.com, and available in the Snack Shack when the pool opens.

Registration Forms may be dropped off at the RWCID Community Center lockbox which is located by the door nearest the parking lot. They can be mailed to:  RWCID c/o DNI   662 Office Parkway   St. Louis, Missouri 63141.  Registration Forms can also be given to a Pool Committee Representative during Memorial Weekend if available or left in the lockbox.  The lifeguards will not be taking forms this year.

Everyone is encouraged to get their forms in early so pool cards will be ready at the Snack Shack the first time you want to swim.  Members that get their registration forms in by May 29, 2016 will get two free guest passes.  The fastest way is to drop them in the lockbox.  Pool cards will be needed to enter the pool.  There will also be a daily sign in sheet for members and guests. Guest passes will be available for purchase at the Snack Shack.

For a safe and fun summer of swimming please review the 2016 RWCID Pool Member Rules, Regulations, and Registration sheet printed in this issue of The Round Robin.   Copies can also be picked up at the Snack Shack when the pool opens or soon on the RWCID website. Happy swimming!
