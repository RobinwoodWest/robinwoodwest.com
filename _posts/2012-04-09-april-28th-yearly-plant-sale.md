If you are looking for a few plant varieties that tolerate our climate, the plant sale is the place to be!  Our Garden Club is sponsoring the plant sale to help with funding for the upkeep of the shrubs and plants at the entry islands and at the Community Center and Pool.  Come browse the variety of plants and meet our neighborhood volunteers that make the neighborhood beautiful!!

Saturday, April 28th

8:00 AM at the Robinwood West Community Center
