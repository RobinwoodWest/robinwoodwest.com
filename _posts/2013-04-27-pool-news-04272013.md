A few changes have been made to the <a title="2013 RWCID Pool Member Rules" href="http://www.robinwoodwest.com/pool-rrr-2013/">RWCID Pool Rules for 2013</a>.
The guest fee has been increase this year from $2 to $3. There are also now two guest pass punch card options. You can purchase a 20 visit pass for $40 or a 10 visit pass for $25.

The Pool Membership Desk (PMD) will open on Saturday at Noon, same as pool opening, and be staffed most hours the pool is open for the first couple weeks. We encourage you to turn in your registration form as soon as possible to avoid delays in receiving your Pool Member ID cards. If received by 8 pm on May 27, 2013, residents will receive two free guest passes, a $6 value! New this year, non-residents who turn in their non-resident application form by 8 pm on May 27, 2013, will also receive two free guest passes.
