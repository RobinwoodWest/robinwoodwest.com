Our senior residents gather once or twice a month to take a field trip to a local shop, restaurant, or exhibit.  These outings have included the <a href="http://www.robinwoodwest.com/ai1ec_event/silver-robins-outing-march2012">Missouri History Museum</a>, the Transportation Museum, and many other local St. Louis attractions.  This group also sponsors an annual Christmas Party for the resident kids, complete with a visit from Santa!

See the current list of events at the <a href="http://www.robinwoodwest.com/our-community/calendar/?ai1ec_cat_ids=24#action=ai1ec_month&ai1ec_post_ids=">Silver Robins calendar</a>.
