Warning!!!!!   Be on the lookout for suspicious persons entering parked vehicles in and around your subdivisions. Numerous cars on whispering Pines had property stolen out of the vehicles.
Please lock your car doors! Remove valuable articles! Don’t be a victim of something you can control. If you observe any suspicious activity call 911 and report it immediately. Don’t wait!
