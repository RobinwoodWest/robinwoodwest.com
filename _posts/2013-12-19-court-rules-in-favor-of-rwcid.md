    August 9, 2011 election and associated
    tax levy are valid and not in violation
    of state statute or Constitution.

After more than two years of court proceedings, Judge Richard Bresnahan ruled that the election held by the RWCID in 2011 was valid, and that there was nothing improper, unconstitutional or in violation of  the Missouri statutes. The ruling also upheld the validity of the property assessment and refinancing of debt. All court costs were charged to the Plaintiffs in the case.

Please join me in thanking our attorney, Michael Wagner of Clayborne Sabo Wagner LLP, for his efforts in successfully defending the District.

Steve O'Rourke
RWCID President
