On June 10, 1999, the Robinwood West subdivision became St. Louis County’s first Community Improvement District through <a href="http://ww5.stlouisco.com/Scripts/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getdoc&DocId=10721&Index=D%3a%5cDTINDEX%5cOrdinances&SearchForm=%2fordinance%2fdtSearch_form%2ehtml" target="_blank">County Ordinance No. 19.500</a>.  Like libraries or school districts, the Robinwood Community Improvement District (RWCID) is a political subdivision of the State of Missouri.  As such, our neighborhood has our own set of bylaws, but we also must abide by county, state and federal laws.
 
This committee is made up of neighborhood volunteer residents to help guide the neighborhood in areas of compliance with rules and bylaws established for Community Improvement Districts.  This group of dedicated individuals provides recommendations to the RWCID Board for amendments to the District’s bylaws, rules, regulations, process documents and election proceedings.  The committee also supports the election efforts of the RWCID and provides a forum for discussion around changes and edits to bylaws and rules that govern the Community Improvement District.
