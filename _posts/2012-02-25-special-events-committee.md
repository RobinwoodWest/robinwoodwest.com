This fun group of neighborhood volunteer residents coordinates social opportunities in the neighborhood. These events include parties and other special events sanctioned by the district. Past events have included things like

<ul>
	<li>Neighborhood Pot Luck and Parade</li>
	<li>Chill Out Camp Out and Chili Cookoff in the Common Greenspace</li>
	<li>Movie Nights at the Pool</li>
	<li>Spring Fling Events</li>
</ul><br>

If you have a suggestion for a social event, feel free to contact our committee chair with your ideas! We are always looking for fresh ideas to gather and socialize with our neighbors.
